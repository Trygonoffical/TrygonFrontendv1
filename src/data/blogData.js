    content: `
            <div class="prose max-w-none">
              <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In a world where over 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices, mobile-first design is no longer optional—it’s essential. By prioritizing mobile experiences from the start, businesses can boost conversions, enhance usability, and improve SEO rankings.
              </p>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why Mobile-First Matters in 2024</h2>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                With Google's mobile-first indexing and the dominance of smartphones, designing for small screens first ensures your site is accessible, fast, and user-friendly across all devices.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. Simplify Navigation</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Use hamburger menus, sticky headers, and collapsible sections to make navigation intuitive and space-efficient.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. Optimize Load Speed</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Compress images, use lazy loading, and leverage CDN networks to ensure your site loads quickly on slower mobile networks.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. Design for Thumbs</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Place buttons, CTAs, and interactive elements within thumb-friendly zones to make interaction effortless.
              </p>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">SEO Benefits of Mobile-First Design</h2>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Mobile-friendly sites are favored in Google rankings, have lower bounce rates, and offer better user engagement—key signals for search engines.
              </p>

              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700">

            <div class="prose max-w-none">
              <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                In 2024, e-commerce is booming—but so are cyber threats. Protecting your customers’ personal and payment data isn’t just a legal obligation, it’s the foundation of trust in your brand.
              </p>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Why E-commerce Security is Critical</h2>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Data breaches, phishing attacks, and payment fraud are on the rise. A single security lapse can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and loss of customer loyalty.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">1. Implement SSL Encryption</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) ensures data transmitted between the browser and server is encrypted, preventing interception.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">2. Use Multi-Factor Authentication</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Adding an extra verification step significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to accounts and admin panels.
              </p>

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">3. Keep Platforms Updated</h3>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Regular updates and patches close security loopholes and protect against known vulnerabilities.
              </p>

              <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Customer Trust and SEO Benefits</h2>
              <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Secure websites rank higher in search results and enjoy better customer retention. Trust badges and clear privacy policies also boost conversion rates.

      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Concurrent rendering allows React to prepare multiple UI states in the background, ensuring smoother user experiences and reducing blocking updates.
